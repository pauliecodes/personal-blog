        I've always loved building and creating. Programming has been my way to put all my ideas into something tangible
        since I was a teenager and got my first laptop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, I made the decision to put my imposter syndrome aside and start contributing to Open Source.
        I started with <a href="https://npmx.dev" target="_blank">npmx.dev</a>, an amazing project that really inspired
        and motivated me, with a community that immediately welcomed me.
      </p>

        When I am not programming, I enjoy going on walks and runs. I am also a big aviation nerd, and I love gaming,
        movies, shows and books/comics.
        Oh, and I love musicals. Hamilton is incredible.

        This is my corner of the internet — a place to write about what I'm learning, building, and thinking about.
