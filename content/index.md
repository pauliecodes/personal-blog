    I've always loved building and creating. Programming has been my way to put all my ideas into something tangible since I was a teenager and got my first laptop.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recently, I made the decision to put my imposter syndrome aside and start contributing to Open Source. 
    I started with <a href="https://npmx.dev" target="_blank" class="font-bold not-prose">
        npmx.dev,
      </a> an amazing project that really inspired and motivated me, with a community that immediately welcomed me.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I am not programming, I enjoy going on walks and runs. I am also a big aviation nerd, and I love gaming, movies, shows and books/comics.
    Oh, and I love musicals. Hamilton is incredible.  
  </p>

  <p>
    This is my corner of the internet — a place to write about what I'm learning, building, and thinking about.
